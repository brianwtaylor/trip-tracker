## 🚨 **Risk Mitigation**

### **Technical Risks**
```
• Battery drain: Monitor closely, implement adaptive sampling
• Accuracy issues: Start with Level 1, validate before Level 2
• Privacy concerns: Design for privacy-first, get legal review
• Platform changes: Use Google Play Services for compatibility
```

### **Business Risks**
```
• Timeline delays: Phase approach allows incremental delivery
• Budget overruns: Clear phase boundaries, validate before advancing
• User adoption: Focus on UX in Phase 3, gather feedback early
• Insurance partnerships: Start conversations early, show working system
```

### **Contingency Plans**
```
• Level 2 delays: Level 1 is viable MVP, can launch with 70-80% accuracy
• Battery issues: Implement more aggressive sampling, user controls
• Accuracy problems: Focus on clear use cases, educate users on limitations
• Partnership delays: Build strong solo value proposition first
